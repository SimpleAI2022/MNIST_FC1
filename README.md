# MNIST_FC1

### repo description
In this repository a 2-layer Fully Connected Neural Network model is developed for classifying the MNIST dataset. The notebook the walks the user through the following steps in writing such classifiers:

* Importing relevant packages
* Writing a model class
* Testing the model class (in order to make sure that the dimensions of the input images and the output data are as expected)
* Writing a check accuracy function (the test loop)
* Defining hyperparameters, device, model, optimizer, and loss function
* Downloading the MNIST dataset and making dataloaders for them
* Writing the training loop

### repo dependencies
* torch
* torchvision
